## Design

**Colour Scheme**

The colours used are very simple indeed. I did not want to take from the images of food or the simple conveying of the message about the restaurant. There is a slight red theme in some of the images.

**Typography**

The Poppins, Aquafina and Lato fonts are used here as they are extremely easy to read and pleasant to look at. Ballet was used for the logo to style the name of the restaurant.

**Imagery**

Imagery is important. The large, main image is to show the user how freshly prepared the food is. The carousel below the descriptioin of the restaurant continues to scroll between images of the food.

## _Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section_

**First Time Visitor Goals**

As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the band.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. The Navigation bar has the band's logo in it's content. Underneath there is an image of the band performing in their wedding attire.

The user has two options, click the HOME, WHAT WE DO or CONTACT action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about [*Acoustra*](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=acoustra "Acoustra on YouTube").

As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be user friendly. At the top of the page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
The Navbar stays in position as the user scrolls or clicks one of the "action" options.
All content has been kept on one page to provide easy scrolling and access to each content. Since it was only three different pages of information it was a lot easier to keep them together and provide links to each part of the band's content.

At the bottom of the page there are clear links and icons to [*Acoustra's*](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=acoustra "Acoustra on YouTube") social media content.
On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is filled it will send information to the band's email. If all forms are not filled out correctly a warning will appear to fill in what you have forgotten to do so.

As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what the couples who hired [*Acoustra*](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=acoustra  "Acoustra on YouTube") thought of them and see if they are a reliable good lively band. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how well known they are.

Once the new visitor has read the About Us and Band Promise text, they will notice the What we do section.
The user can also scroll to the bottom of the page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is shown a badge to link them to [WBA](https://weddingbandassociation.ie/ "Wedding Band Association"), a site that [_Acoustra_](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=acoustra "Acoustra on YouTube") are a member of. This provides opportunities for several other bands to chose from for the user should they not be able to book the band. It also provides security for how reliable [*Acoustra*](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=acoustra "Acoustra on YouTube") are.


As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new gigs the band are playing and any new songs they may have added to their repetoire.

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
Here they can fill out the form on the page.
The footer contains links to the Acoustra's [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Acoustra/ "Acoustra on Facebook"), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/acoustra?lang=en "Acoustra on Twitter"), [Instagram](https://www.picuki.com/tag/Acoustra "ACoustra Instagram Posts") and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1IcCTGmLR5P0IZUBXE4FvD "Acoustra Original Music") pages as well as the band's email.
Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the social media links to be able to keep up with the band's ongoing updates.


### **Frequent User Goals**

As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added gigs or new song releases.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click social links.

As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new content information.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click to the section they are looking for.

As a Frequent User, I want to check in at anytime as to the whereabouts of the band incase they are in my area performing.

At the bottom of the page their is a footer which content is easily acceessable.

### **Further Testing**

The Website was tested on Google Chrome in the development tools.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop and mobile view
A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
I got my wife and son to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### **Known Bugs**
In the validation some results were returned that i did not believe were that important as to have any affect on the webpages performance. The page clearly performed as it was meant to.
All links in Navbar are working perfectly but the drop down menu in the mobile view seems to stay on the dropdown menu when the link is clicked and the user has to X out of that window to view their selection.
